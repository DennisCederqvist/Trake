# Trake

Trake is a modern Snake-inspired browser game built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.  
The project focuses on responsive gameplay, visual clarity, sound feedback, and extensible game systems.

The game features a polished singleplayer experience and an experimental multiplayer mode.

## 📝 Project Notes
This project was developed as part of a school assignment with a fixed deadline.  
Due to time constraints, further multiplayer iteration was deprioritized in favor of polishing core gameplay, audio feedback, and overall user experience.
